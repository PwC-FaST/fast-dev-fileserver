### ESDAC - LUCASSOC

**Name**: Topsoil Organic Carbon Content (LUCAS) (SOC_Brogniez)

**URL**: [download](/data/esdac/lucassoc.zip)

**Description**: Continuous Raster Layer, in g/kg

**Resolution**: 500m

**Info**:
Soil organic carbon is a measureable component of soil organic matter. Sequestering carbon in SOC is seen as one way to mitigate climate change by reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide. The argument is that small increases of SOC over very large areas will significantly reduce net carbon dioxide emissions from agriculture. For the reduction to be long-lasting, organic matter would have to be in the more stable or resistant fractions (Table 1). For more information see Soil organic carbon and carbon sequestration.
